# Java Assignments
## Semester 1
### Assignment 1
- Part 1: Creates instance of the Dog class uses setters and getters to add and display information.
- Part 2: Asks the user for a number between 1 and 10. Prints the input is valid.
### Assignment 2
Creates 3 instances of the Students class and adds them to an array. Set the info for each student and iterate through the array, displaying the info.
### Assignment 3
Creates an array for 3 Movie objects. Iterates through the array, adding user input for info about each movie. Iterates through the array again, this time displaying the info with the formatted toString.
### Assignment 4
Creates an array of user specified length to store Student objects. Populates the array with user inputted data and then displays it with the toString.
### Assignment 5
Creates an ArrayList collection of Student objects. Populates the list and uses a list iterator to iterate throught the list forwards and then backwards.
### Assignment 6
Creates an ArrayList of Students that may be of UnderGraduate or PostGraduate subtype. Traverses through the ArrayList and adds the info for each student (Name, StudentId, 5 test results). It then loops throught the ArrayList again and displays the students info, type of student they are and whether their average constitutes a pass or fail (40+ required for Undergrad, 50+ required for Postgrad).
## Semester 2
### Assignment 1
Creates four instances of SalesPeople, two SalesAgent and two SalesEmp. Adds them to an ArrayList and asks the user to enter the sales for each employee. Calculates the commission for each employee based on their type and percentage indicated in the Commission interface. Prints info.
### Assignment 2
Action, Comedy, and Drama are subclasses of the abstract Film superclass. The program calculates the late fee due based on the user inputted number of late days and the film type. 
### Assignment 3
Asks the user how many bags of coffee were sold and the weight of each bag in kilos. It then calculates and displays the price per kilo, sales price, sales tax rate, sales tax, and total price.
### Assignment 4
Creates instances of Bike with a value for cadence, gear, and speed. Calls the speedUp or applyBrake methods to demonstrate how you may increment or decrement the speed value.
### Assignment 5
- Part 1: Asks the user to enter a sentence, displays the sentence in full upper and lower case, then divides the sentence into tokens.
- Part 2: Asks the user to enter two strings, then calls StringCompare to determine if they are equal or not.
### Assignment 6
Allows the user to enter as many integers as they want and adds them into an ArrayList (auto-boxing). Uses try catch block to prevent a program crash if the value entered is not an integer. Loops through the ArrayList and prints the value at each index position (auto-unboxing).
